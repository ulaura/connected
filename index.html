                A little HTML widget gave us all-powerful Amazon and Facebook.
                There's no closing Pandora's text box now. The
                <strong>form</strong> element has two important attributes:
                action and method . The action attribute specifies a URL that
                will process the form submission. In this example, the action is
                the /signup URL. The method attribute specifies the HTTP method
                to submit the form with. Usually, the method is either post or
                get

              <h1>The Healing Power of JavaScript</h1>
              <p>
                For some of us—isolates, happy in the dark—code is therapy, an
                escape and a path to hope in a troubled world. JavaScript (JS)
                is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled
                programming language with first-class functions. While it is
                most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many
                non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache
                CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based,
                multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting
                object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional
                programming) styles. Read more about JavaScript.
